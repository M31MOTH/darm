darm - intelligent network sniffer for the masses

darm is an attempt to create a very easy to use app that will sniff and report information about the activities happening on a live network. The main goal is to help the public to truly become aware about the extent of current network security. darm is being developed by Leandro Tami as a project for fun.

Current features:

- Sniffs live network interfaces or capture files and analyzes them, getting important protocol-specific information such as IP addresses and port numbers.
- Supports ethernet, ip and tcp protocols
- Reassembles tcp threads, and dumps them to files when they are closed (FIN or RST), or when darm is forced to close.
