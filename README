darm - intelligent network sniffer for the masses (this is a fork of leandrinux original code)

darm is an attempt to create a very easy to use app that will sniff and report information about the activities happening on a live network. The main goal is to educate the public so that it becomes aware of the security of their communications. darm is being developed by leandrinux as a project for fun.
 
Current features:

- Sniffs live network interfaces or capture files and analyzes them, getting important protocol-specific information such as IP addresses and port numbers.
- Supports Ethernet, 802.11, IP, ARP, UDP, TCP and DNS protocols
- Reassembles tcp threads, and dumps them to files when they are closed (FIN or RST), or when darm is forced to close.
